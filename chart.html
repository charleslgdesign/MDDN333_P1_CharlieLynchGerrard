    <b>Charlie Lynch-Gerrard<br/>
        Project 1<br/>
        MDDN333<br/>
        <br/></b>
    This chart is a recording of my screen usage over 20 days. 
    <br/><br/><b>Emergant patterns</b> can be found in periods where I am busy with audio work. 
    These are followed by days that are spent doing more university. 
    Another pattern that I'm observant of is that time spent on <b>Spotify</b> tends to fluctuate inverted to <b>FL Studio.</b>
    This makes alot of sense considering that audio work cannot be done at the same time as listening to music, 
    however the opposite tends to happen with school work. I would describe this as a <b>rebounding</b> pattern because of the contrast particularly between <b>Google</b> and <b>FL Studio</b>. 
    <br/><br/>
    Similarly, <b>sequences</b> like these are present in trading markets because of the tension between the sellers and buyers. 
    For example, the momentum of a stock going up in price becomes more likely to go downwards due to the downward buy pressure.
    <br/><br/>
    This <b>dataset</b> has given me a sense of <b>clarity</b> for future budgeting of time. This is particularly important as a student where life can get really busy. 
    To further this project, I would be interested in tracking this data over a <b>longer period of time</b>.
