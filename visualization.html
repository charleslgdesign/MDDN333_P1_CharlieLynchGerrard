    The purpose of this <b>visualization</b> was to gain more control over my limited time as a student.
    A comparitive display of the time in ellipses really helped me examine the differences between each application. 
    Each circle's size <b>(radius)</b> is a total of all the <b>20 days</b> multiplied by <b>15</b>. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Personally</b>, I think this reflects on the regularity of my schedule. I find that having a consistant schedule helps me complete tasks, especially those that are drawn out over multiple days/weeks. 
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The <b>scavolding</b> used was very <b>minimalist</b>. This was intentional as the data isn't displayed in a <b>typical graph format.</b>
    I decided to animate my visualization to show the true scale of the ellipses. This is because the data could be interpreted differently considering the area of the circles overlap.
